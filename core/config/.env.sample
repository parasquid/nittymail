# Optional: number of concurrent IMAP connections used to preflight mailboxes
# (discover UID lists in parallel). Default is 1.
#MAILBOX_THREADS=4

# Optional: automatically purge rows from older UIDVALIDITY generations
# after a successful sync of a mailbox when a change is detected.
# Accepts: yes/true/1 (case-insensitive). Default is disabled.
#PURGE_OLD_VALIDITY=yes

# Optional: number of UIDs to fetch per IMAP request (batching reduces round-trips).
# Default is 100.
#FETCH_BATCH_SIZE=100

# Optional: ignore certain mailboxes during sync. Comma-separated list.
# Supports simple wildcards * and ?.
# Default recommendation: ignore Spam and Trash to reduce noise.
#MAILBOX_IGNORE="Spam,Trash"

# Optional: strict error handling for debugging. When enabled, some
# recoverable errors will be raised instead of logged and skipped
# (e.g., duplicate rows, encoding/JSON errors, invalid Date headers).
#STRICT_ERRORS=yes

# Optional: retry attempts for transient IMAP SSL/IO errors during fetch.
# Default: 3. Set to -1 to retry indefinitely. Set to 0 to disable retries.
#RETRY_ATTEMPTS=3

# Optional: prune mode to delete rows that are no longer present on the server
# for a mailbox's current UIDVALIDITY (based on preflight diff). Default disabled.
#PRUNE_MISSING=yes

# Optional: SQLite WAL journaling. Default is enabled by the CLI (better write performance).
# Set to 'no' to disable: SQLITE_WAL=no
#SQLITE_WAL=yes

# Optional: sqlite-vec configuration for vector embeddings (future RAG features)
# The sqlite-vec Ruby gem is used to load the extension automatically.

# Dimension to use when creating the virtual table. Default 1024 (recommended for high-quality OSS models like bge-m3/mxbai-embed-large).
#SQLITE_VEC_DIMENSION=1024

# Embedding model to use via Ollama (documentation hint; used by future features)
# Recommended default: English-focused high-quality model
