# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-07-mailbox-subcommand-refactor/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

- **File Structure**: Create new directory `cli/commands/mailbox/` with separate files for each subcommand
- **Class Hierarchy**: Each subcommand class inherits from `Thor` and implements its specific command logic
- **Method Extraction**: Move existing method implementations from main Mailbox class to respective subcommand classes
- **Error Handling Preservation**: Maintain identical error handling patterns including ArgumentError, IMAP errors, and unexpected errors
- **Option Definitions**: Transfer all `method_option` definitions exactly as they exist in the current implementation
- **Import/Require Management**: Ensure all necessary requires are present in each new subcommand file
- **Thor Integration**: Update main Mailbox class to use Thor's `subcommand` feature for delegation
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain exact same CLI interface so existing scripts and documentation remain valid
